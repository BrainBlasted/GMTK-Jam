A repository for my submission the 2017 GMTK Game Jam. As of now, it is in the very early prototyping stage.
# The plan:
- Create a Kid Icarus inspired game using only open source or source-available tools.

# Design:
- Scrolling shooter
- Monsters
- The "health" bar is a vigor bar, meaning all actions, like attacking and dashing are tied to it. The more vigor you have, the higher damage your attacks do. To regain vigor, you kill enemies.
- Three levels, one arcade-like, two bosses

# Building:
- Install Godot Engine 3.0 by either building it yourself or from a pre-compiled package
- Import the project
- Export or run the project.
