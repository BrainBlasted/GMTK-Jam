A repository for my submission the 2017 GMTK Game Jam.
# The plan:
- Create a Kid Icarus inspired game using only open source or source-availble tools.
# Building:
- Install Godot Engine 3.0 by either building it yourself or from a pre-compiled package
- Import the project
- Export or run the project.
